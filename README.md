# Streaming Pipeline for NYC Bike-sharing App and Analysis of User Activity

# Objective: 
The goal of this project is to share real-time information about citi bikes in NYC and also get historical trip data for analyzing trips and improving user experience for customers.

# Motivation: 
For someone who enjoys all kinds of sports and outdoor activities and is a travel enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for activities that are easily accessible. Having this problem statement in mind I wanted to capture and publish data on bike-sharing apps across NYC as it is always bustling with locals and tourists alike.

# Scope: 
The analysis has 2 data sources
**Part I: Real-time data**
**Data:** I am using GBFS real-time feed from Citi Bikes NYC. GBFS stands for Global Bikeshare Feed Specification. It is a global standard for sharing system information about various bike stations across a country, city, and region along with details like the number of docks, availability of bikes at a given timestamp, station id, region id, plans and pricing
**Objective:** Collect real-time data for designing the backend of the app for getting the dimensions like 
Regions:  
Station_status: 
Free_bike_status: 
Ebikes_at_station: 

The GBFS standard has the following feeds for real-time system information
The over-arching feed has an array of key: value pairs of the name of the feed and the JSON file for the feed
name: **ebikes_at_stations**,
 Url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/ebikes_at_stations.json

name: **system_information**,
 url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/system_information.json

name: **station_information**,
 url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/station_information.json

name: **station_status**,
 url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/station_status.json

name: **free_bike_status**,
url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/free_bike_status.json

name: **system_regions**,
url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/system_regions.json

name: **system_pricing_plans**,
 url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/system_pricing_plans.json

name: **system_alerts**,
url: https://gbfs.lyft.com/gbfs/1.1/bkn/en/system_alerts.json

**Part II: Historical trip data**
**Data:** Citi bikes also shares downloadable CSV files of historical trips which goes back to 2013 when they started the bike-share service and collect data.
Historical Citibike trip data : https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

**Objective:** Analyze user activity across all stations to find out interesting insights like 
- What is the highest trip distance taken?
- Avg trip per day/week/month? Depending on who is the audience for the visualization
- What time of the day were the trips taken
- What are the most popular stations?
**Tech Stack**
- Real-time data analysis
  - Apache Flink for capturing real-time feed from bike stations like station id, number of docks, bikes available, bikes booked and bikes 
  disabled and partition by region id
  - Store into relational database to maintain ACID properties as we donâ€™t want  to show a booked bike as available
  Move to Apache Iceberg for analytics

- Historical Data Analysis and Visualization
  - Convert csv to Parquet files in Apache Iceberg as 
  - Parquet compresses the data and Iceberg offers pointers to last updated file which saves full file scan and time travel
  - Aggregate data for weekly and monthly analysis of rides, popular stations, average distance traveled
  - Create Dash plots for interactive visualization
